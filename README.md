# Tree Detection in Satellite Imagery using CNNs and SAM

This Google Colab notebook demonstrates an automated approach for detecting individual trees in satellite imagery. 
It leverages the power of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction, enhanced by the precise segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). 
By integrating these advanced deep learning techniques with the geospatial processing capabilities of the leafmap library, this project enables users to accurately identify and locate trees within user-defined regions of interest.

# Results:

Figure displays the results of an automatic tree detection algorithm applied to a section of satellite imagery, likely in an urban or semi-urban environment given the presence of buildings and roads. The key elements of the figure are:

- Satellite Imagery: The background shows a high-resolution aerial view, revealing individual buildings with varying roof colors and shapes, road networks, and patches of vegetation.
- Detected Trees: The dark green, irregularly shaped areas represent the canopies of individual trees.
- Bounding Boxes (Red Rectangles): Each detected tree canopy is enclosed within a red bounding box. These boxes indicate the algorithm's identified locations and extents of the trees.

The figure suggests that the automatic tree detection algorithm has successfully identified a significant number of individual trees within the scene. The red bounding boxes appear to closely encapsulate the visible tree canopies.
